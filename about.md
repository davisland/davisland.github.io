Hi! My name is Davis Land.

I&#39;m a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.

I like to make stuff.

Currently I&#39;m an intern at [WBUR Boston](wbur.org) in the newsroom. I help write and interview for the hourly newscast and often join producers out in the field. 

I was formerly an intern at [Transom.org](http://transom.org) in Woods Hole, MA. At Transom I got my first taste of producing things for the public media worldâ€”over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate. Thinking back, it was a trememdous oppurtunity and I definitely didn&#39;t realize how awesome it was to be with those folks. Transom will always hold a special place in my heart.  

Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for two publications: [The Eckleburg Project](http://theeckleburgproject.com), which is A&amp;M&#39;s student-run literary journal, and [Alien Mouth](http://alienmouth.com), an independent journal and press I started with a friend.

I work for the [Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu) where I produce a podcast called [Write Right](http://writerightpodcast.github.io) which will be launching soon. I&#39;ve also served as the Programming Director for [KANM Student Radio](http://kanm.org) for a good while now, while djing and volunteering at [KEOS Community Radio](http://keos.org). I also produce a podcast for [Write About Now Poetry](http://writeaboutnowpoetry.com), which is in its third season of production.

I&#39;ve gained a lot of different skills through making stuff; here&#39;s an incomplete list: audio and video editing, web design and computer programming, how to do writing good, emailing (it&#39;s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that&#39;s also a skill I think), book binding, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br><br><br>
