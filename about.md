Hi! My name is Davis Land.

I&#39;m a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.

I like to make stuff.

I work for the [Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu) where I produce a podcast called [Write Right](http://soundcloud.com/WriteRight). I talk to experts in writing and communication about some of the questions, ideas, and interests that students have. I also work for the [Texas A&amp;M Foundation](http://www.txamfoundation.com/s/1436/gid3give/2014/index.aspx?sid=1436&gid=3&pgid=4203) where I help produce their podcast about different programs at A&amp;M.

I was formerly an intern at [Transom.org](http://transom.org) in Woods Hole, MA. There I got my first taste of producing content for the public media world, from pitching to reporting, editing, and all the in-between. Over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate.

Over the summer of 2016 I was an intern at [WBUR Boston](wbur.org) in the newsroom. I helped write and report for the hourly newscast and often joined producers out in the field. There I learned how to write on a deadline, and work in a fast paced and sometimes-stressful environment.  

Additionally, I&#39;ve done a bit of freelance reporting and production assistance. I have by-lines with [Texas Standard](http://texasstandard.org), [WCAI](http://capeandislands.org) and [The Battalion](http://thebatt.com). 

I&#39;ve also served as the Programming Director for [KANM Student Radio](http://kanm.org) for a good while now, where I build out and direct student DJs to produce and air music, talk, and fictional content. Before I was Programming Director at KANM I helped with preproduce content and interviews for the station. These segments are, unfortunately, lost to the sands of time. I also produce a podcast for [Write About Now Poetry](http://writeaboutnowpoetry.com) and helped build their YouTube channel. I the past I was a  dj/volunteer at [KEOS Community Radio](http://keos.org). 

Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for two publications: [The Eckleburg Project](http://theeckleburgproject.com), which is A&amp;M&#39;s student-run literary journal, and [Alien Mouth](http://alienmouth.com), an independent journal and press I started with a friend. I've been inovolved with other arts efforts, often ephemeral yet still substantial projects. Ask me about it! 

I&#39;ve gained a lot of different skills through all of that; here&#39;s an incomplete list: audio and video editing, web design and computer programming, how to do writing good, emailing (it&#39;s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, filing public information requests, Twitter (that&#39;s also a skill I think), book binding, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite, cooking, having a critical eye, screen-printing, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br>
