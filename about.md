Hi! My name is Davis Land.

I&#39;m a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.

I like to make stuff.

I work for the [Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu) where I produce a podcast called [Write Right](http://soundcloud.com/WriteRight). I talk to experts in writing and communication about some of the questions, ideas, and interests that students have. I also work for the [Texas A&amp;M Foundation](http://www.txamfoundation.com/s/1436/gid3give/2014/index.aspx?sid=1436&gid=3&pgid=4203) where I help produce their podcast about different programs at A&amp;M.

I was formerly an intern at [Transom.org](http://transom.org) in Woods Hole, MA. There I got my first taste of producing content for the public media world, from pitching to reporting, editing, and all the in-between. Over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate.

Over the summer of 2016 I was an intern at [WBUR Boston](wbur.org) in the newsroom. I helped write and report for the hourly newscast and often joined producers out in the field. There I learned how to write on a deadline, and work in a fast paced and sometimes-stressful environment.  

Additionally, I&#39;ve done a bit of freelance reporting and production assistance. I have by-lines with [Texas Standard](http://texasstandard.org) and [The Battalion](http://thebatt.com). I've also done some work for [Write About Now](http://www.writeaboutnowpoetry.com/), as a podcast producer and video production assistant.

I served as Programming Director for [KANM Student Radio](http://kanm.org) for most of my college career. As Programming Director I built out the show schedule and directed student DJs to produce and air music, talk, and fictional content, all while hosting my own weekly show. Before I was Programming Director at KANM I helped with produce content and interviews for the station. These segments are, unfortunately, lost to the sands of time. In the past I was a volunteer DJ and board operator at [KEOS Community Radio](http://keos.org).

Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for [Alien Mouth](http://alienmouth.com), an independent journal and press I started with a friend. I also served as Editor-In-Chief of [The Eckleburg Project](http://theeckleburgproject.com), Texas A&amp;M’s student literary and arts journal. I’ve been involved with other ephemeral yet substantial arts efforts. Ask me about them!

I&#39;ve gained a lot of different skills through all of that; here&#39;s an incomplete list:  ProTools, the Adobe Creative Suite (namely Audition, Premiere, Illustrator, and Photoshop), how to do writing good, Microsoft Office, Slack, various CMS platforms, writing, filing public records requests, emailing (it’s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that’s also a skill I think), book binding, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br>
