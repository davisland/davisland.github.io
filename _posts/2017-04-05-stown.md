excerpt: "A podcast full of potential ethical landmines."
---

On March 28th, podcasting giant __Serial__ from radio giant __This American Life__ launched a new podcast—__S-Town__, a venture which has now achieved popularity beyond what __Serial__ was ever able to do. Of course, all of the typical coastal-elite publications loved it. Glowing reviews popped up in __Vulture, The New York Times, The Atlantic__, and countless other publications. But only one venue, __Vox.com__, noticed the troubling aspects of S-Town, going so far as to claim “it probably shouldn’t have been made” in the headline of [a piece by Aja Romano](www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/30/15084224/s-town-review-controversial-podcast-privacy).

Romano’s piece focuses in on privacy as the central concern with __S-Town’s__ ethics. Large parts of __S-Town__ are focused on the main subject’s sexuality, an aspect of his life he mostly kept quiet in his small Alabama town. Journalism ethics would typically tell us to shut up about these things if we don’t have full and clear permission to divulge them, but __S-Town__ wanders a fine line. Discussions of this character’s private life are nested in compassion and empathy, so much so that any listener could see how the discussion could be warranted. But there are further concerns. __S-Town__ deals with money, racism, suicide, and much more. All of these are potential ethical landmines. 

But central to this conversation, at least in my opinion, is one question: why did this need to be made? As far as I can tell, __S-Town__ exists because the reporter, Brian Reed, had such a personal connection to his subject. The podcast reads as a testament to empathy and understanding, and if we’re comfortable with that justification, maybe it’s alright to jump so deeply into a character with the same unclear pretense as Reed does. But even with this justification, it’s hard to read __S-Town__ as anything but ultimately exploitative. Even if it is a work about understanding someone else’s humanity, is this endeavor permissible without the subject’s ultimate consent?
