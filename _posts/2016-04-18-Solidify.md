Well I bought a plane ticket. I'm doing what Kayak calls a "hacker fare" where you buy the two cheapest one-way tickets. Let's hope that works. 

I mentioned [in my last post](http://davisland.info/broke/2016/04/08/Ready.html) that I applied for a workshop with ProPublica. I didn't end up getting in, which is disappointing. However, in some ways that's a relief as well, considering that the workshop started on the same day my internship was supposed to start. The anxiety of getting permission and making sure schedules would work seemed like something I really did not want to go through.

Right now I'm thinking about how I'm going to get my stuff there in the cheapest way. Check a bag, ship myself a box? I'll report next with my breakdown of prices on that front.
