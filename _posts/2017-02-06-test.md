What was last November but a month spent in media hell? Blindsided by Donald Trump’s election, members of the press were left questioning how, exactly, they didn’t see a Trump win coming. 

Most of this questioning went on in the public sphere. An [open letter from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/elections/to-our-readers-from-the-publisher-and-executive-editor.html) to its readers was perhaps the most visible example of an anxious and exhausted press. But [numerous calls](https://twitter.com/ashlynstill/status/796419470659092482) for journalists to pay more attention to the people outside of their newsrooms filled the echo chamber of media-Twitter. Trump’s victory in the election, it seemed, was also a victory against the press he so often attacked.

While commonly held as a symptom of [“filter bubbles”](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles) and an unprecedented ability for the average citizen (and journalist!) to tune out conversations and ideas outside of their interest, the shock of journalists around the country could be explained as well through the mainstream press as characterized by right-wing media.

“Over time, we’d succeeded in delegitimizing the media altogether,” writes Charles Sykes, a former conservative talk radio host, "all the normal guideposts were down, the referees discredited.” Sykes's [op-ed for The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/opinion/sunday/charlie-sykes-on-where-the-right-went-wrong.html) decries the now-typical operating procedure of conservative media. Over the course of the Obama presidency, he says, conservative talk radio vilified the mainstream press to an extent that public trust in journalism all but disappeared. Real information was impossible to separate from misinformation—the conservative voter would not accept negative attention directed towards Trump; it must have been a creation of the left.

Sykes’s position is one which sheds a new light on our little problem in journalism. We are faced not just with rampant lies and intentional redirections, but with a massive issue of information stratification, a problem streching across political parties, spectrums of trust, and the temptations of confirmation bias. The solution has yet to be found.
