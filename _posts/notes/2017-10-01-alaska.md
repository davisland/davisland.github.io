I have another shot at this Alaska job, should hear sometime this week if I got it. I hope that happens.

Things I fantasize about:
*not telling anyone except the most essential people I'm going.
*taking pictures in cool places along the way (multi-day drive)
*starting over away from pressures of people that I know/who know me
*I get to be alone pretty much
*I get to host Morning Edition which means I get up early
*I would probably buy a kayak
*consistent source of money
*working in a station that is majority volunteer-run

I don't know why it feels like I need to abandon my surroundings/friend groups every ~2 years. This seems like the most extreme version of that.
