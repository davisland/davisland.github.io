*   news articles & commentary (seems kind of boring)
*   reviews of things (still commentary I guess, but maybe weirder)
*   general updates on what I'm making (what am I, a brand now?)
*   small little bits of narrative nonfiction writing?
*   run by a bot, curates all of my social media posts (dang maybe i'll just make this too)
