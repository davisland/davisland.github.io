Just got back from seeing <i>Dunkirk</i>. 

The time differences between storylines tripped me up a bit, and there was a moment or two in the third act that I thought were annoying (though you can't really make a war movie without being overly dramatic in some way, in some part of the film, so it really is excusable I guess).

The cinematography in general was excellent; the dog fights were especially well done. They had a cool idea to anchor the camera to different boats as they sank, which was cool sometimes, and unnecessary at others. The ending shots of the last pilot frustrated me. Actually, the resolution to that plot line frustrated me. Probably the weakest point of this movie.

On a list titled "Christopher Nolan Movies I Like," I would mark <i>Memento</i> as the first one and this movie as the second. I think those are the only two movies I would add. 

I paid the extra money to see this in a big theater (not IMAX big, but big enough) and I do not regret it.

I would call this movie 'arresting.'

Good job Christopher Nolan, sincerely, random internet person who doesnâ€™t know nearly as much about movies as you or the other people who made this.
