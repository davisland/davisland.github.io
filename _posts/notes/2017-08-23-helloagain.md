I forgot about this

now I'm in a similar spot as I am with my newsletter. that is, what do I do with this? 

also how should I approach grammar here? I like not capitalizing anything but proper nouns & sometimes leaving sentences without periods

who really needs a captial letter at the beginning of the sentence anyways?
