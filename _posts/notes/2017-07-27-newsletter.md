lmao check out this idea:

newsletters as the future of local journalism. if twitter feels like what TV once was (at least to me: always on; selectivity over what you view but not total control; big & coporate at this point with a view community outlets), then the email inbox is where you see your neighbors (your local acquaintances, and you see your best friends not at the bar but in an IM). people pay for community newsletters â€” not much, either. it's email, it's cheap. email is on your phone and on your computer, and you can access it with fewer barriers than current digital efforts by newspapers.

okay that was the idea this post is over now.
