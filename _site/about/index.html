My name is Davis Land.</p><p>I'm a recent graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.</p><p>I like to make stuff.</p><p>Currently, I work as a full time freelancer at <a href="http://houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/author/dland/">Houston Public Media</a> as a general assignment reporter. I cover just about everything, but take particular interest in environmental issues.</p><p>I also freelance for <a href="http://redriverradio.org/">Red River Radio</a>, covering the city of Lufkin and the wider East Texas region.</p><p>Previously, I worked for the <a href="http://writingcenter.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center</a> where I produced a podcast called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/WriteRight">Write Right</a>. Write Right takes on big, complex topics in communication, linguistics, and education, and presents them in a compelling, digestible format through narrative storytelling. I did everything for the show including research, interviewing, writing, editing, and mixing. Several excellent administrators at the Writing Center help edit my scripts. If there is one project through which I learned the most, it’s this one.</p><p>From the summer of 2016 through this past spring, I worked for the <a href="http://www.txamfoundation.com/s/1436/gid3give/2014/index.aspx?sid=1436&amp;gid=3&amp;pgid=4203">Texas A&amp;M Foundation</a> where I helped produce a podcast about different programs at A&amp;M. I helped write the script, edit, score, and mix each episode.</p><p>Over the summer of 2016 I was an intern at <a href="wbur.org">WBUR Boston</a> in the newsroom. I helped write and report for the hourly newscast and often joined producers out in the field. There I learned how to write on a deadline and work in a fast paced and sometimes-stressful environment.</p><p>I was formerly an intern at <a href="http://transom.org">Transom.org</a> in Woods Hole, MA. There I got my first taste of producing content for the public media world, from pitching to reporting, editing, and all the in-between. Over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate.</p><p>I've done a bit of freelance reporting and production assistance. I have by-lines with <a href="http://texasstandard.org">Texas Standard</a> and <a href="http://thebatt.com">The Battalion</a>. I’ve also done some work for <a href="http://www.writeaboutnowpoetry.com/">Write About Now</a>, as a podcast producer and video production assistant.</p><p>In 2017, my friend Brie Ripley and I started <i><a href="https://soundcloud.com/dearpodcast">Dear</a></i>, a podcast wherein Brie and I write audio letters to one another. We did it to force oursleves to make something out of the ordinary on a regular basis. You should check it out.</p><p>I served as Programming Director for <a href="http://kanm.org">KANM Student Radio</a> for most of my college career. As Programming Director I built out the show schedule and directed student DJs to produce and air music, talk, and fictional content, all while hosting my own weekly show. Before I was Programming Director at KANM I helped with produce content and interviews for the station. These segments are, unfortunately, lost to a hard drive which the university reclaimed and then sold as “surplus” (this taught me to always make backups).</p><p>In the past I was a volunteer DJ and board operator at <a href="http://keos.org">KEOS Community Radio</a>. There I learned a lot about FCC regulations and, as I programmed a lot of punk music on my show, became intimately familiary with what exactly crosses the line. (Of course, I stayed inside of it.)</p><p>From August of 2015 through 2016, I served as Editor-In-Chief of <a href="http://theeckleburgproject.com">The Eckleburg Project</a>, Texas A&amp;M’s student literary and arts journal. I’ve been involved with other ephemeral yet substantial arts efforts. Ask me about them!</p><p>I've gained a lot of different skills through all of that; here's an incomplete list: ProTools, the Adobe Creative Suite (namely Audition, Premiere, Illustrator, and Photoshop), how to do writing good, Microsoft Office, Slack, various CMS platforms, writing, filing public records requests, emailing (it’s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that’s also a skill I think), book binding, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br /><br /></p><p><a href="http://davisland.info/Land_Resume.pdf">Here is a link to my resume.</a></p><p><a href="http://airmedia.org/author/airusert301434670219">Here is my profile on AIR.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davisland">Here is my profile on LinkedIn.</a></p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/davis_land">Here is my profile on Twitter.</a></p><footer></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
