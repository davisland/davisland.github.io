    <p>Hi! My name is Davis Land.</p>

<p>I'm a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.</p>

<p>I like to make stuff.</p>

<p>I work for the <a href="http://writingcenter.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center</a> where I produce a podcast called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/WriteRight">Write Right</a> which will be launching soon. I also work for the <a href="http://www.txamfoundation.com/s/1436/gid3give/2014/index.aspx?sid=1436&amp;gid=3&amp;pgid=4203">Texas A&amp;M Foundation</a> where I help produce their podcast.</p>

<p>I was formerly an intern at <a href="http://transom.org">Transom.org</a> in Woods Hole, MA. There I got my first taste of producing content for the public media world, from pitching to reporting, editing, and all the inbetween. Over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate.</p>

<p>Over the summer of 2016 I was an intern at <a href="wbur.org">WBUR Boston</a> in the newsroom. I helped write and report for the hourly newscast and often joined producers out in the field. There I learned how to write on a deadline, and work in a fast paced and sometimes-sressful environment. My experience at WBUR totally transformed my writing, as well as the editorial process.</p>

<p>I've also served as the Programming Director for <a href="http://kanm.org">KANM Student Radio</a> for a good while now, while djing and volunteering at <a href="http://keos.org">KEOS Community Radio</a>. I also produce a podcast for <a href="http://writeaboutnowpoetry.com">Write About Now Poetry</a>, which is in its third season of production.</p>

<p>Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for two publications: <a href="http://theeckleburgproject.com">The Eckleburg Project</a>, which is A&amp;M's student-run literary journal, and <a href="http://alienmouth.com">Alien Mouth</a>, an independent journal and press I started with a friend.</p>

<p>I've gained a lot of different skills through all of that; here's an incomplete list: audio and video editing, web design and computer programming, how to do writing good, emailing (it's a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that's also a skill I think), book binding, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite, cooking, having a critical eye, screenprinting, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br /><br /><br /></p>
