My name is Davis Land.</p><p>I'm a student at Texas A&amp;M University, studying Telecommunications and Media Studies.</p><p>I like to make stuff.</p><p>I work for the <a href="http://writingcenter.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University Writing Center</a> where I produce a podcast called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/WriteRight">Write Right</a>. I talk to experts in writing and communication about some of the questions, ideas, and interests that students have. I also work for the <a href="http://www.txamfoundation.com/s/1436/gid3give/2014/index.aspx?sid=1436&amp;gid=3&amp;pgid=4203">Texas A&amp;M Foundation</a> where I help produce their podcast about different programs at A&amp;M.</p><p>I was formerly an intern at <a href="http://transom.org">Transom.org</a> in Woods Hole, MA. There I got my first taste of producing content for the public media world, from pitching to reporting, editing, and all the in-between. Over the summer I had a total of three stories air on WCAI, the local NPR affiliate.</p><p>Over the summer of 2016 I was an intern at <a href="wbur.org">WBUR Boston</a> in the newsroom. I helped write and report for the hourly newscast and often joined producers out in the field. There I learned how to write on a deadline, and work in a fast paced and sometimes-stressful environment.</p><p>Additionally, I've done a bit of freelance reporting and production assistance. I have by-lines with <a href="http://texasstandard.org">Texas Standard</a> and <a href="http://thebatt.com">The Battalion</a>. I’ve also done some work for <a href="http://www.writeaboutnowpoetry.com/">Write About Now</a>, as a podcast producer and video production assistant.</p><p>I served as Programming Director for <a href="http://kanm.org">KANM Student Radio</a> for most of my college career. As Programming Director I built out the show schedule and directed student DJs to produce and air music, talk, and fictional content, all while hosting my own weekly show. Before I was Programming Director at KANM I helped with produce content and interviews for the station. These segments are, unfortunately, lost to the sands of time. In the past I was a volunteer DJ and board operator at <a href="http://keos.org">KEOS Community Radio</a>.</p><p>Currently I serve as the Editor-In-Chief for <a href="http://alienmouth.com">Alien Mouth</a>, an independent journal and press I started with a friend. I also served as Editor-In-Chief of <a href="http://theeckleburgproject.com">The Eckleburg Project</a>, Texas A&amp;M’s student literary and arts journal. I’ve been involved with other ephemeral yet substantial arts efforts. Ask me about them!</p><p>I've gained a lot of different skills through all of that; here's an incomplete list: ProTools, the Adobe Creative Suite (namely Audition, Premiere, Illustrator, and Photoshop), how to do writing good, Microsoft Office, Slack, various CMS platforms, writing, filing public records requests, emailing (it’s a skill, trust me), being funny sometimes, Twitter (that’s also a skill I think), book binding, cooking, having a critical eye, driving in Boston, paying off a credit card, being a leader, the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, tying shoes, high fiving, being a direct communicator, and a few more things.<br /></p><p><a href="http://davisland.info/Davis_Land_Resume_2016.pdf">Here is a link to my resume.</a></p><p><a href="http://airmedia.org/author/airusert301434670219">Here is my profile on AIR.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davisland">Here is my profile on LinkedIn.</a></p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/davis_land">Here is my profile on Twitter.</a></p><footer><div class="links"> <a href="http://davisland.info">home</a> <a href="/about/">about</a> <a href="/connect/">connect</a> <a href="/samples/">samples</a></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
