They had a cool idea to anchor the camera to different boats as they sank, which was cool sometimes, and unnecessary at others. The ending shots of the last pilot frustrated me. Actually, the resolution to that plot line frustrated me. Probably the weakest point of this movie.</p><p>On a list titled “Christopher Nolan Movies I Like,” I would mark <i>Memento</i> as the first one and this movie as the second. I think those are the only two movies I would add.</p><p>I paid the extra money to see this in a big theater (not IMAX big, but big enough) and I do not regret it.</p><p>I would call this movie ‘arresting.’</p><p>Good job Christopher Nolan, sincerely, random internet person who doesn’t know nearly as much about movies as you or the other people who made this.</p><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
