I hope that happens.</p><p>Things I fantasize about: *not telling anyone except the most essential people I’m going. *taking pictures in cool places along the way (multi-day drive) *starting over away from pressures of people that I know/who know me *I get to be alone pretty much *I get to host Morning Edition which means I get up early *I would probably buy a kayak *consistent source of money *working in a station that is majority volunteer-run</p><p>I don’t know why it feels like I need to abandon my surroundings/friend groups every ~2 years. This seems like the most extreme version of that.</p><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
