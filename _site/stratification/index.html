Blindsided by Donald Trump’s election, members of the press were left questioning how, exactly, they didn’t see a Trump win coming.</p><p>And most of this questioning went on in the public sphere. From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/elections/to-our-readers-from-the-publisher-and-executive-editor.html">a New York Times open letter</a> to its readers to <a href="https://twitter.com/ashlynstill/status/796419470659092482">numerous calls</a> for journalists to pay more attention to the people outside of their newsrooms, the collective confusion and rationalization was obvious. Trump’s victory in the election, it seemed, was also a victory against the press he campaigned against.</p><p>While commonly shown as an issue of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles">“filter bubbles”</a> and an unprecedented ability for the average citizen (and journalist!) to tune out conversations and ideas outside of their interest, the shock of journalists around the country could be explained as well through the mainstream press as characterized by right-wing media.</p><p>“Over time, we’d succeeded in delegitimizing the media altogether,” writes Charles Sykes in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/opinion/sunday/charlie-sykes-on-where-the-right-went-wrong.html">op-ed for The New York Times</a>, “all the normal guideposts were down, the referees discredited.” Sykes ran a conservative talk radio through the 2016 election, leaving his position at the end of the year. He notes that, over the course of the Obama presidency, conservative talk radio vilified the mainstream press to an extent that public trust in journalism all but disappeared. Real information, he writes, was impossible to separate from misinformation—the conservative voter would not accept negative attention directed towards Trump; it must have been a creation of the left.</p><p>Sykes’s position is one which sheds new light on our little problem in journalism. We are faced not with rampant lies and intentional redirections (though those certainly occur), but with a massive issue of information stratification not only across political parties, but across spectrums of trust and confirmation bias. The remedy still remains to be found.</p><footer><div class="links"> <a href="http://davisland.info">home</a> <a href="/about/">about</a> <a href="/connect/">connect</a> <a href="/samples/">samples</a></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
