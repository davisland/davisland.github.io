They had a cool idea to anchor the camera to different boats as they sank, which was cool sometimes, and unnecessary at others. The ending shots of the last pilot frustrated me. Actually, the resolution to that plot line frustrated me. Probably the weakest point of this movie.</p><p>On a list titled “Christopher Nolan Movies I Like,” I would mark <i>Memento</i> as the first one and this movie as the second. I think those are the only two movies I would add.</p><p>I paid the extra money to see this in a big theater (not IMAX big, but big enough) and I do not regret it.</p><p>I would call this movie ‘arresting.’</p><p>Good job Christopher Nolan, sincerely, random internet person who doesn’t know nearly as much about movies as you or the other people who made this.</p></p><hr width="625px" /><h3><a href="/blog/2017/07/25/playground.html">first grade playground story</a></h3><h6>2017-07-25 20:23:15 -0500</h6><p><p>When we talk about it, we generally say things like, oh, it was all a blur. Things happen fast, but certainly faster in memory. I think the kid’s name was Clay. I’m not sure I saw him again after that Thursday. He was out Friday too. Maybe he finished out the year. The anti-climactic part is that I just don’t know.</p><p>My first year of elementary school was the last that things were, as we seem them now, unsafe. There were two platforms to play on outside the school — one tall, and the other very tall. Both were made of wood and a steel that we would find so hot come recess time that it’s a wonder we didn’t get too burned. The ground was covered in dirt and mulch, not those rubber pads they had now. We didn’t know any better. Columbine had yet to happen. Splinters were very normal on the playground. So too were scraped knees, and on exceptionally fun days, a broken arm.</p><p>This movie had just come out— Spy Kids. We were playing some made up game centered around Spy Kids. I’m not sure any of us had actually seen it except one kid, who was maybe named Jordan. Again, memory. I’m sorry. Regardless, the game involved running. Now that I think about it, I’m pretty sure it was just tag with a new name. We had a larger crowd than normal playing. Clay, myself, maybe five other kids.</p><p>My class, while joining several others at recess time, played mostly at the downhill portion of the playground on the tall platform, not the very tall one. While the other was taller, this platform was superior in the number of attachments— a slide, a fireman’s pole, at least three different ways to climb up that weren’t a ladder, and monkey bars. I hadn’t yet been able to do the monkey bars, at least not past three bars out from the wooden platform which they were built off of. Three bars were a standard for our age. This I know for sure. It was a matter of much discussion who could get the farthest on the monkey bars.</p><p>Again, this game involved running, and probably some pushing, and some made up sounding names for each other that may or may not have been a part of the franchise. The chase had found itself with the tall platform, not the very tall one, in its path. We all climbed up as rapidly as possible, So, while looking backwards, wary of whomever was ‘it,’ and grinning, of course, I ran into Clay from behind as he looked out at the monkey bars.</p><p>I honestly do not remember the next part, and I didn’t really realize what was happening at the time. One second I was running and the next there was Clay, on the ground, crying hysterically, blood seeping out of his mouth, his lip split.</p><p>Mrs. Johnson would later ask me why I did it, why I ran into Clay. The question was so baffling that I didn’t have an answer, and just ran off to play again. Later, out of breath from running while thinking of an answer, I stammered, “It was an accident,” and gave no further explanation. I’m still unsure I she believed me.</p></p><hr width="625px" /><h3><a href="/blog/2017/07/25/idea.html">new idea</a></h3><h6>2017-07-25 05:00:00 -0500</h6><p><p>stripped down website where i semi-publicly post ideas, drafts, whatever feels too weird to post to facebook</p></p><hr width="625px" /></div><br><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
